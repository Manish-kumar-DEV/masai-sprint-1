            <div class="text-default">Field hockey is a widely played team sport of the hockey family.
                The game can be played on grass, watered turf, artificial turf or synthetic field, as well as an indoor boarded surface. 
                Each team plays with ten field players and a goalkeeper. 
                Players commonly use sticks made out of wood, carbon fibre, fibre glass or a combination of carbon fibre and fibre glass in different quantities to hit a round, hard, plastic hockey ball.
                The length of the hockey stick is based on the player's individual height: the top of the stick usually comes to the players hip, and taller players typically have taller sticks.
                 The sticks have a round side and a flat side only the flat face of the stick is allowed to be used; if the other side is used it results in a foul. 
                 Goalies often have a different kind of stick; however, they can also use an ordinary field hockey stick. 
                 The specific goal-keeping sticks have another curve at the end of the stick, this is to give them more surface area to save the ball. 
                 The uniform consists of shin guards, shoes, shorts or a skirt, a mouthguard and a jersey.

                Today, the game is played globally, mainly in parts of Western Europe, South Asia, Southern Africa, Australia, New Zealand, Argentina, and parts of the United States</div>

            <div class="text-default">
                The India men's national field hockey team was the first non-European team to be a part of the International Hockey Federation.
                 In 1928, the team won its first Olympic gold medal and until 1960, the Indian men's team remained unbeaten in the Olympics, winning six gold medals in a row.
                  The team had a 30–0 winning streak during this time, from their first game until losing in the 1960 gold medal final.
                   India also won the 1975 World Cup. India's hockey team is the most successful team ever in the Olympics, having won eight gold, one silver and two bronze medals.
                    After their gold medal win at the 1980 Olympics, the team's performance declined through the next three decades, with the team failing to win a medal at the Olympics or the World Cup.
                     In 2016, the Indian men's team won its first ever silver medal in Champions Trophy and reached the knockout stage of the Olympics for the first time in 36 years.
                      As of 2020, the team is ranked fourth in the world. From February 2018, the Government of Odisha has started sponsoring the Indian national field hockey team, both men and women team.
                       In a first-of-its-kind association, the state has decided to support the India's field hockey team for next five years.

                The Indian Women's Hockey Team is the national women's team representing hockey in India. (nicknamed the Nabhvarna) is the national women's team that represents India in international field hockey competitions.
                 The team is currently coached by Canada's Mathias Ahrens and led by halfback Ritu Rani from Haryana and is currently ranked 13th in the FIH World Rankings.
                  Captain Suraj Lata Devi led the team to the Gold for three consecutive years: during the 2002 Commonwealth Games (the event which inspired the 2007 Shah Rukh Khan film, Chak De India), the 2003 Afro-Asian Games, and the 2004 Hockey Asia Cup.
                   They were referred to as the "Jassi (Jasjeet) jaisi koi nahi" or "Golden girls of hockey," after winning the 2004 Hockey Asia Cup.
                    During the summer of 2015, the team hosted the Round 2 of the 2014–15 Women's FIH Hockey World League and finished on top to qualify for the next stage.
                     At the World League Semifinals held in Antwerp the team finished in the fifth place beating higher ranked Japan in classification match.
                      The Indian woman's national field hockey team has thus qualified for the 2016 Summer Olympics for the first time since the 1980 Summer Olympics.
